        <h1>Autonomous LiDAR Robot Project</h1>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The autonomous LiDAR robot project, completed two years ago, focused on creating a system that could map environments 
            using LiDAR technology for customized customer use. The initial phase involved researching and choosing the right 
            hardware components, such as a LiDAR sensor, microcontroller, and motorized platform. The main goal was to design a 
            robot that could move on its own and create 3D maps in real-time based on customer needs. A key factor in the success 
            of the project was the strong teamwork formed by connecting with a group of graduate students. Their different skills 
            in robotics, software development, and hardware helped the team work well together, solve problems quickly, and come 
            up with new ideas that pushed the project forward.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In the second phase, the focus shifted to software development. The robot was programmed to process LiDAR data, build 
            point clouds, and implement pathfinding algorithms for autonomous navigation. A significant challenge during this 
            stage was ensuring accurate object detection and map generation while maintaining real-time performance. The team 
            developed custom algorithms to optimize data processing and improve the robot's ability to avoid obstacles and map 
            areas accurately. Additionally, I used my soldering skills to carefully assemble the robot's electrical components 
            and crafted the base of the robot to ensure stability and durability. This hands-on work was crucial for integrating 
            the hardware with the software and ensuring the robot's performance.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Finally, the robot was tested in various environments to ensure its adaptability to different customer needs. 
            Customization options were integrated to allow users to define specific areas or features they wanted mapped. 
            Post-project, feedback from customers highlighted the robot's flexibility, ease of use, and efficiency in real-world 
            applications. The success of the project was evident, and we had the opportunity to showcase our completed work in 
            front of a panel of judges and other students. This presentation allowed us to demonstrate the robot's capabilities, 
            discuss the challenges we overcame, and highlight the impact of the project. The positive response and recognition 
            further confirmed the project's value and the skills we gained throughout the process.</p>
