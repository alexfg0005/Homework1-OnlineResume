        <h1>Freshman Year E10 Class - Robotics Project</h1>

        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In my freshman year, I took an E10 class where we were tasked with building a robot designed to perform a set of 
            challenges, such as finding a beacon and hitting a button. The project began with learning about basic robotics 
            principles, including motor control, sensors, and programming techniques. Our first step was to design and assemble the 
            robot using simple components, like motors for movement, sensors for detection, and a microcontroller to control 
            everything. As a group, we discussed how to approach the tasks and made sure the robot could navigate its environment 
            and complete the required actions autonomously.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Once the physical build was completed, we focused on programming the robot to carry out specific tasks. This phase involved 
            coding the robot to search for the beacon using sensors, navigate around obstacles, and reach its target efficiently. The 
            most difficult challenge was ensuring the robot could find the beacon and accurately hit the button without making 
            mistakes. Through trial and error, we tested different approaches to fine-tune the robot's behavior, and after many 
            adjustments, the robot was able to perform the tasks consistently and with precision.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">After several rounds of testing and tweaking, the robot was ready for the final challenge. We successfully demonstrated 
            the robot's ability to find the beacon and hit the button in front of the class. The project was a great learning 
            experience, where I not only strengthened my problem-solving and programming skills but also worked closely with 
            classmates to achieve our goals. The project's success highlighted the importance of teamwork, persistence, and learning 
            from mistakes, and it gave us valuable hands-on experience that prepared us for more advanced robotics tasks in the 
            future.</p>
